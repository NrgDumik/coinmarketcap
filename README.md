# coinmarketcap

There is a useful page called `CryptoCurrency Market Capitalizations` for viewing the current state of the crytocurency markets.

[https://coinmarketcap.com/tokens/views/all/](https://coinmarketcap.com/tokens/views/all/)

The site shows all currencies runing today on a number of platforms. I'm interested in the ones running on `Ethereum` which have a `Market Cap`. Since, the site doesn't have this specific filtering capability I thought it would make a good project to grab the data from the page and filter it the way I'd like.

To do this I decided to investigate `Pandas` and it's `read_html` function for pulling data in from html tables.
